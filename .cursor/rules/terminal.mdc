# Terminal/Commandline use Guidelines
- Always use `uv` as the package manager, do not use pip
    - virtual enviranment is located in `.venv`
    - Activate venv using `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - To add new packahe `uv add [package_name]`
    - To remove/uninstall package `uv remove [package_name]`
    - Check `pyproject.toml` [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) to check dependencies

- Use task runner when necessary
    - We are using `Taskfile.yml` please check [Taskfile.yml](mdc:Taskfile.yml) for all tasks
    - Important tasks
        - `task lint` fixes lint issues with ruff, runs pylint and pyright after that
        - `task run` starts the streamlit app
