    "# Playlist Sorter Notebook\n",

    "This notebook implements a `PlaylistSorter` class to sort music playlists based on harmonic mixing (Camelot keys), BPM, and energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "*   Loads playlist data from a CSV file.\n",
    "*   Requires columns: `Track`, `Camelot`, `BPM`, `Energy`.\n",
    "*   Builds a Camelot wheel neighbor map.\n",
    "*   Finds a suitable opener track based on energy (and optionally popularity).\n",
    "*   Sorts the playlist by finding the best transitions based on Camelot key compatibility and BPM similarity.\n",
    "*   Exports the sorted playlist to a new CSV file.\n",
    "*   Optionally prints the Camelot and BPM transition paths."

    "## Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook and installing packages, it's best practice to create an isolated Python environment using `venv`. This prevents conflicts between project dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**\n",
    "2.  **Navigate to your project directory** (where you saved this `.ipynb` file).\n",
    "3.  **Create the virtual environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m venv venv \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (You can replace `venv` with any name you prefer for the environment folder).\n",
    "4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**\n",
    "    *   **Windows (Command Prompt):** `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "    *   **Windows (PowerShell):** `venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` (You might need to adjust execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process`)\n",
    "    *   **macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):** `source venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You'll know it's active because your terminal prompt will usually show the environment name (e.g., `(venv) Your-Computer:project_folder $`).\n",
    "5.  **Install required packages:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install pandas numpy jupyterlab # Or 'pip install pandas numpy notebook' for classic notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "6.  **Start JupyterLab (or Notebook):**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    jupyter lab\n",
    "    # or\n",
    "    # jupyter notebook \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This will open Jupyter in your browser, running with the packages installed in your virtual environment.\n",
    "7.  **Deactivate (when done):** Simply type `deactivate` in the terminal."
